\subsection{VisTool}

VisTool is a Meta-Design model developed by SÃ¸ren Lauesen that proposes an original approach to enable users to tailor their software and to become active members of the design team. It specifically emphasis on a systematic way to tailor and adapt user interfaces and visualize relational data.



Like other meta-design models, VisTool can be operated under a ``designer mode'' and a ``user mode''. The design mode allows end-users to adapt

\subsubsection{A runtime bound to the local operating system}

Two types of source files are needed for generating a User Interface with VisTool. Vism files and Vis files. During the application's runtime, the vism file is opened first. The vismfile contains a reference to the initial vis file that is then opened.

This "chaining" of the source files causes the current system to be bound to the computer's operating system. A user provides the initial ``vism'' file available on the file system and uvis can trust that the link provided to the initial ``vis'' file is located on the same file system.
