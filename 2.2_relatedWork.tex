\subsection{VisTool}

The current system is running under windows...

\subsubsection{A runtime bound to the local operating system}

Two types of source files are needed for generating a User Interface with VisTool. Vism files and Vis files. During the application's runtime, the vism file is opened first. The vismfile contains a reference to the initial vis file that is then opened.

This "chaining" of the source files causes the current system to be bound to the computer's operating system. A user provides the initial ``vism'' file available on the file system and uvis can trust that the link provided to the initial ``vis'' file is located on the same file system.
