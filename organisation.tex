\subsection{Structure of the applications}

At this point, before discussing the mentioned concepts an introduction of the structure of the three distinct applications that are provided in the annexe will help the reader to better follow as we go along. By structure I mean how the source files are organized and how the application can be built and executed on the other hand. This will be the occasion to also speak about the development environment that I have created locally on my computer in order to build the applications. By structure, I also and particularly want to emphasis on how I have attempted to organize the internal parts of the kernel for a better separation of concerns.

\subsubsection{Source Files and Building the Projects}

The sample application that is meant to run on the visEngine. The resource provider function of the consumer application should be configured in such a way that it points to that folder and in principle the visEngine should be able to find the vism files that the user navigates to (if it exists).
